# Definitions

Credit History: A record of a person's past borrowing and repayment behavior. A good credit history (value 1.0) signals financial responsibility and greatly improves the chance of loan approval.

Loan Amount: The principal amount of money the applicant is requesting as a loan. It is typically expressed in thousands of rupees.

Loan Term: The period (in months) over which the applicant agrees to repay the loan. Common terms are 360 months (30 years).

Applicant Income: The monthly earnings of the main loan applicant. Higher applicant income improves the probability of approval.

Coapplicant Income: The monthly income of a second person (such as a spouse or parent) applying jointly for the loan. This increases total household income and often boosts loan eligibility, especially for low-income primary applicants.

Dependents: The number of individuals financially dependent on the applicant, such as children or elderly parents. A higher number of dependents may reduce disposable income and slightly lower approval chances.

Education: Indicates whether the applicant is a "Graduate" or "Not Graduate". Education level showed little correlation with loan approval rates.

Self Employed: Indicates whether the applicant is self-employed. Such applicants often face slightly lower approval rates due to income irregularity.

Property Area: The location of the property being financed â€” Urban, Semiurban, or Rural. Applicants from Semiurban areas had the highest approval rates.

Marital Status: Indicates if the applicant is married. This feature did not significantly affect approval outcomes.

Gender: Gender (Male or Female) had minimal influence on loan approval. Approval rates were similar when controlling for income and credit history.

# Key Insights

A good credit history (1.0) is one of the strongest predictors of loan approval.

Applicants without a credit history (0.0) had much lower approval rates, even with moderate to high income.

Living in a Semiurban area positively affected approval chances more than Urban or Rural areas.

Applicants earning less than Rs. 3000 per month were typically rejected unless supported by high coapplicant income or a longer loan term.

Strong coapplicant income often made a decisive difference, especially for lower-income main applicants.

Self-employed applicants required higher income levels than salaried individuals, due to perceived financial uncertainty.

Shorter loan terms (e.g., 120 months) were sometimes favored when paired with strong credit and income profiles.

Financial variables like income and credit history were more predictive than personal characteristics like gender, marital status, or education.

Female applicants were approved at similar rates to male applicants when financial metrics were equal.

The number of dependents only negatively influenced approval when income was already low.
